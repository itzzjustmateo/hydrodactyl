# Agent Guidelines — Hydrodactyl

Rules that bind all agents working in this repository. They override inherited
instructions where the two conflict. Precedence: **(1)** safety constraints,
**(2)** directory-scoped rules, **(3)** validation gates, **(4)** general
conventions.

## 1. Safety constraints (never overridden)

- Do not create, modify, or close GitHub issues or pull requests unless the
  user explicitly asks. When the user asks, open the PR against upstream
  `BlueprintFramework/hydrodactyl` (base `main`) and only commit + push after
  the user approves.
- Do not run `git merge --abort`, `git reset --hard`, or `git push --force`,
  and do not delete branches, without explicit user approval.
- Do not commit local environment artifacts (currently: `.php-version`).
  Do not `git add -A`/`git add .`; stage only intended files.
- Do not add, replace, or upgrade Composer/npm dependencies without explicit
  user approval. Reuse existing dependencies whenever the current stack can
  solve the problem.
- Handle merge conflicts in the working tree; never resolve them by deleting
  another branch's changes wholesale.

## 2. Branding (logo) subsystem — directory scoped

Files:
- `app/Services/Admin/LogoService.php` — domain logic
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/Settings/LogoController.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/Admin/Settings/LogoFormRequest.php`
- `resources/views/admin/settings/logo.blade.php`
- `tests/Integration/Admin/Settings/LogoControllerTest.php`

Rules:

- `LogoService` is the single source of truth for logo state. Read the current
  logo and history through `getCurrentType()`, `getCurrentValue()`,
  `getCurrentUrl()`, `getHistory()`; persist through `handle()`. Do not read
  or write `settings::app:logo:*` settings keys directly from controllers,
  views, or scripts.
- Brand color: persist as `settings::app:brand_color`, read as
  `config('app.brand_color', '#52A9FF')`. Blade views must render it through
  config (e.g. the fallback SVG in `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`
  and the `logo.blade.php` history highlight); never hardcode the hex in
  markup.
- Raster uploads must be converted to WebP (quality 85) before saving. SVG
  uploads must pass `LogoService::sanitizeSvg()`; do not weaken it (it strips
  `<script|iframe|object|embed|applet|foreignObject|use>`, `on*` attribute
  handlers, and `javascript:`/`data:` hrefs).
- Only enqueue `queue:restart` when `app:name` changed. Logo-only and
  brand-color changes must not restart workers.
- PHP 8.5+: never call `imagedestroy`/`imagedestroy`; rely on PHP garbage
  collection for GD images in tests.
- `customNavItems` (`config('app.custom_nav_items')`) is consumed by the React
  router (`UnifiedRouter.tsx`) and must be preserved in
  `resources/scripts/state/settings.ts` and `SiteSettings` when editing
  settings state.

## 3. Validation gates (must pass before considering a task complete)

- Frontend: `pnpm check` — must exit 0 with no pending biome fixes.
- Backend: always run PHP/Artisan/PHPUnit through the project-local wrapper:
  `lerd php -d memory_limit=512M vendor/bin/phpunit`. Never invoke bare
  `php` or `artisan`. Full suite must pass, including
  `LogoControllerTest`.
- Run biome (`pnpm exec biome check --write`) only on files you modified;
  never reformat unrelated files.

## 4. General conventions

- Prefer existing panel patterns (Blade layouts, `resources/scripts` React
  components, Formik, easy-peasy stores, SWR hooks) over introducing new
  frameworks or abstractions.
- Upgrade/refactoring of core, non-branding code (Docker images, Wings,
  admin layouts) stays in the upstream codebase; keep changes scoped to this
  fork's branding work unless the user explicitly expands scope.
- Do not silently change behavior of a setting documented as "not yet wired"
  (e.g. brand color) without updating its warning text and the PR
  description.
- When rules are ambiguous or a step is uncertain, ask one short clarifying
  question and stop; do not invent requirements.
